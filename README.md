## RGB Color Selector, Due 10/05/2025
This program allows the user to drag three sliders correlating to the values red, green, and blue. Whatever values the user chooses will be directly displayed next to the sliders. The full color will be displayed in the background, as well as represented in hexadecimal format under the sliders. The user can choose to save any color they make to a list, and can view the information for any of the colors in the list by clicking on them.
